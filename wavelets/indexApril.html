			<h2>Course Overview</h2>

			<p>
			<img src="../images/Canoes75pct.jpg" class="float-left">

			Welcome to the Wavelets Webpage at the University of St. Thomas.  Two National Science Foundation (DUE0442684 and DUE0717662) grants have supported the development of an undergraduate course on 			wavelets and their applications, two texts, software, final projects, and the Wavelets in Undergraduate Website.  The course has been taught twelve times at the University of St. Thomas and 				world wide.  prerequisite knowledge is the calculus sequence and familiarity with matrix arithmetic.  The course makes heavy use of Mathematica (or MATLAB) and follows an <i>applications-				first</i> model:  Students are introduced to some rudimentary wavelet transforms, quantization tools, and coding schemes and then are immediately immersed in applications such as image 					compression and image boundary detection.  The applications provide strong motivation to learn the more advanced mathematics necessary to build better image processing tools.  Other 
			applications introduced along the way are audio de-noising and image segmentation.  The course concludes with final projects where students can learn about new applications or delve deeper into 			some of the more theoretical aspects of the topic.

			<h2>Workshops</h2>
			<p>
			<a href="../images/workshop09.jpg"><img src="../images/workshop09.jpg" height=100 width=130 class="float-left"></a>
			The grants also provided partial support for six workshops or minicourses for faculty interested in teaching a course on wavelets at their home institutions.  			Four of these workshops 			were conducted through the Mathematical Association of America's Professional Enhancement Program (PREP).  During these workshops, 			faculty members learned about wavelets, software 			implementation, applications of wavelets, final project development, and strategies for teaching the course.  			the links at left contain lecture slides and many labs (in Mathematica 			and MATLAB) used by the participants.

			<h2>New Book!</h2>
			<p>
			<a href="../images/book3.jpg"><img src="../images/book3.jpg" width=60 height=97 class="float-left"></a>New as of <strong>April 8, 2019</strong> is the second edition of the book 
			<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Discrete+Wavelet+Transformations%3A+An+Elementary+Approach+with+Applications%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781118979327">Discrete Wavelet Transformations: An Elementary 			Approach with Applications, 2nd edition</a>.  The new book is a	significant rewrite of the first edition.   The book is divided into two parts - the first develops basic orthogonal and 					biorthogonal wavelet filters and transformations without the use of Fourier methods.  The second portion of the book follows a more traditional development of filters using Fourier methods.  				New applications include image segmentation, image pan-sharpening and the FBI Fingerprint Compression Specification.  Also included are new chapters on wavelet packets and lifting.

			<h2>Previous Books</h2>
			<p>
			<a href="../images/book1.jpg"><img src="../images/book1.jpg" width=60 height=97 class="float-left"></a> I have written a text, 
			<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047018311X.html">Discrete Wavelet Transformations: An Elementary Approach with Applications</a>, published on January 8, 2008, for an 			introductory course on discrete wavelets and applications.  
			</p>
			<p>
			<a href="../images/book2.jpg"><img src="../images/book2.jpg" height=95 width=61 class="float-right"></a> A second book, 
			<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470388404.html">Wavelet Theory: An Elementary Approach with Applications</a>, co-authored with 
			<a href="http://mcs.msudenver.edu/_u_/ruchwebsitehome">David Ruch</a>, was published on October 26, 2009.  This book is intended for use as a text in a topics course for advanced undergraduate 			or graduate students, or as a reference for professionals interested in an introduction to the elementary theory of wavelets.

			<h2>Resources</h2>
			<p>
			<a href="../images/audiowt.gif"><img src="../images/audiowt.gif" width=144 height=89 class="float-right"></a>
			The <i>WaveletWare</i> Package is available in Mathematica and MATLAB (coming soon).  This add-on allows students or researchers to further explore discrete wavelet 	transformations and their 				applications.  Also available under Resources at right are live examples and labs for use with a discrete wavelets course.  The live examples allow users to reproduce many of the example 				results found in the new text and in many instances, offers questions or tasks that allow the user to further investigate or master a concept.
