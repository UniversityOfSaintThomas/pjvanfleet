		<h1>Banana Moon</h1>
			
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
I'm almost done with an album we've been working on for about nine months.  I'm working with this really good music producer named Brian Lenz and we did all the recording in a studio in the attic of the First Covenant Church in Minneapolis.  Click <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/82/64/d38264dc3c8c7e75690e66c06aa71652.jpg">here</a> for a picture.  If you look at the right of the church, you can see a bit of US Bank Stadium, where they played the Super Bowl this year! Brian is from Carroll, Iowa (just west of Ames) and went to UNI.  He's an amazing musician.
</p>
We started work on the album in July and just finished tracking (recording all the parts) at the end of March.  In total, there are 24 people playing/singing on the album.  I do all the lead vocals and all the guitars (except for the extra guitar parts Brian did on "Man with the Candle").  It's amazing what goes into making an album.  
<h3>Cover Concept</h3>
<p>
Our idea for an album cover is to take little "tokens" from some of the songs and make some kind of mural.  Click <a href="https://e.snmc.io/lk/f/l/892abf7b4b2ae07c5b4071515898ee42/1218098.jpg">here</a> for an example.  The center piece would be a banana moon (a crescent moon that looks like a banana) - that's the album title.  And then all around it are other items from different songs - a statue from one song, a mortar board (graduation hat), a ferris wheel, a candle, etc., from other songs.  Ideas for items are given for each song below.  If you want to put the title and my name in the mural somewhere, that'd be good too - otherwise we can add that later.  I think you could sketch, draw, paint, use pictures, etc. - no rules!
</p>
<h3>Recordings</h3>
<p>
Click <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1djCObI8jIJ8JU7b5M2ZZA4GsnyYvzCf5">here</a> for a link with some really rough mixes of all the songs.  Brian has just started mixing so things are all over.  In a few cases, we don't have the final tracks in - mostly on some vocals.  You'll probably need a good set of headphones and even then the mixes might not be that great.  But my hope is you can listen to the songs, read the notes below and get an idea of a cover?

<h3>Album Tracks</h3>

<ol>
<li><span class="bigorange">Oh Academia</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> This is a silly song 			about higher education.  I	played in a band in Texas  		with a guy who was a lawyer and told me "You don't 			need a reason to sue, just an idea." There was also a 		fellow faculty member when I worked in Texas who said 		"I try to be an ass at faculty meetings."  (he was) 
	<li> <strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> I'm thinking 			this song could be represented by a <a 				href="https://www.flagshipfancydress.co.uk/ekmps/shops/flagshipenterp/images/graduate-mortar-board-515-p.jpg">mortar board</a>, maybe hanging off the bottom end of the banana moon?
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">In My Dreams</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong>Pat Van Fleet</span>
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> This was written in the 	
		late 1990's when I was living in Texas but riding 			with a work colleague from St. Louis to Champaign.  I 		hadn't been in Illinois in quite some time and my 			friend didn't talk much so I reminisced about growing 		up in Illinois.  Your mom can tell you about the 			neighbors and hide and seek and the World's Fair in 			Colchester.  The guy playing accordion is maybe 25 			and has 4-5 albums on Spotify.  Check him out:  John 			Mark Nelson.
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> A baseball field 			and/or a ferris wheel.
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Popeye</span><span class="orange"> (featuring Verena Van Fleet)</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong>Lindsay Chase Rose
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> This song was written by 		a friend from Texas who I used to play shows with.  			She didn't like a songwriter name John Prine, who I 			really like.  When I moved up here, she sent me this 			song she wrote and it sounds just like a John Prine 			song.  At the end of the last chorus and the tag, 			listen for Rachel on the flute!
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> We can't use any 		of the Popeye characters because of copyright issues.  		But maybe a can of spinach?
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Sammy on a Stick</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> Rather than write out a 			long story (that's what this song needs!), here's a 			link to a rough version we recorded in May, 2017 that 		starts with the story of the statue.  Click <a href="https://www.reverbnation.com/patvanfleet/song/28248335-sammy-on-stick-live-studio-take">here</a>.  There's also an old 	picture of me and the statue on this site!
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong>  Obviously, we 		need a statue of Sam Houston.  Here is a <a href="http://c8.alamy.com/comp/E7B01C/sam-houston-statue-in-huntsville-texas-E7B01C.jpg">picture</a>.  You can Google <i>Sam 	Houston statue</i> and get lots more.
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Big Fish in a Small Condo</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Heather Feronberg and Pat 			Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong>  Heather is a cousin of 			Johnny Nash (he sang <i>I Can See Clearly Now</i> - 			your 	mom will know the song).  Heather sang with our 		Texas band and had a little thing for the bass player 		who was oblivious.  We wrote this "missed love" song 			as an analogy of a fish that got away.  There was 			beer involved.  We were stuck on the chorus when she 			said "Grand Pescado" 	which is "big fish" in Spanish.  		Then we were rolling - her mom lived in El Segundo 			and drove an El Dorado.  We couldn't figure out where 		to put the fish and originally 	had it as "Big Fish 			in a Small Pondo" which we decided was dumb.  I 			wondered what Jimmy Buffett would do (your mom 	can 			tell you about him) so that's where "Condo" comes 			from!
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> I think a goofy 			looking fish would be perfect for a contribution from 		this song!
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">So Many (featuring Lydia Liza)</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> This was written when 			Rachel was really little.  We were friends with a 			family that had three daughters whose ages were the 			same as Sam, Matt and Rachel.  The dad was a painter 			who never had time to paint and I never had time to 			play music.  So the song is about conflicts parents 			face wanting to be there for their kids but at the 			same time wanting to have a life of their own too.  			They had a little sign in their kitchen that said 			"Babies Never Keep."  The oldest daughter is Lydia 			who goes by the stage name Lydia Liza and is pretty 			famous up here (she recently opened for the Goo Goo 			Dolls).  She and her boyfriend have had over a 				million hits on Spotify for their new version of a 			Christmas song.  Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amK4U4pCTB8">here</a> to 			watch the video.  The violinist (actually it's an 			octave violin) has play several times at the Kennedy 			Center in Washington, DC - he's really good!
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> We're stumped on 		finding a contribution from this song.  It's okay if 			not every song has a contribution - maybe things get 			too busy then?  If you have an idea though, that's 			great!!
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Daddy's Pledge</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> I wrote this in Texas 			right before Sam was born.  I was convinced we were 			going to have a girl so I needed a lullabye song.  It 		took a few tries before Rachel came along!
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> The only thing I 		can thing of is a cloud with lightening and I'm not 			so sure about that - there's just not much material 			stuff in this song like the other ones.  I'd probably 		not have anything from this song unless the cover 			needed a bit more.  But if you have ideas, go for 			it!!
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Beacon</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> This was a last minute 			addition.  The song that follows this one is very 			different than everything else on the album and Brian 		said he wanted an instrumental segue to get to it.  			When the album is done, it will roll continuously 			into the next song.  We had interviewed the subject 			of the next song and Brian pulled out a very powerful 		clip and tagged it to the end of the instumental I 			wrote.
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong>  I don't know 			what this song can contribute since there are no 			lyrics.
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Man with the Candle</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> I wrote this in Texas 			about a professor (Dennis Longmire) in the Criminal 			Justice College at Sam Houston State University.  He 			was the only person in the college who was against 			the death penalty.  The university was in Huntsville 			which is where the main prison system was and where 			they held the executions (we lived about a mile 			away).  Dennis would hold a candle light vigil at 			each execution.  It was always an upsetting event - 			some people made signs celebrating the execution and 			there was a big church right next to the prison with 			seemed to be a contradiction to me.  I spent a lot of 		time on this song (I have trouble playing the guitar 			part I wrote!) and it was being considered as 				background music for a documentary on the A&E channel 		about Dennis (it was cut out at the end of 				production).
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong>  I'm thinking 			the best contribution from this song is a picture of 			the front of Captain Byrd Cemetery - this is where 			they bury prisoners who otherwise have no other 			options.  Click <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/JoeByrdCemeteryHuntsvilleTX.jpg">here</a> for a picture.  You can 			google it and find other pictures.  There could also 			be a candle.
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Learn How to Say Goodbye</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> This is the first real 			song I ever wrote (1987) after the death of a cousin.  		I'd moved away from Farmington and was on my own in 			Southern Illinois.  I didn't mind that so much and at 		the same time I was realizing that the career path 			I'd chosen meant I probably would never go back 			there.  The second verse is about losing a tennis 			player friend (Dean Wilson, your mom will know him) 			and the third verse is about my best boyhood friend.  		We decided the song should have a mandolin so Brian 			and I flipped a coin and I lost and had to play it.  			It took me many tries to get the part right!!
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> I'm not sure 			what we can take from this song?  We could use a 			tennis court but nobody would know what it meant.  			Maybe a man waving goodbye??  Do you have ideas?
	</ul>
<li><span class="bigorange">Texas Friends</span>
	<ul>
	<li>	<strong>Writer:</strong> Pat Van Fleet
	<li>	<strong>Background:</strong> I wrote this a few years 		ago when I was missing my friends from Texas.  Since 			it's the last song on the album, we decided to make 			it a jam song.  There are still some open gaps where 			Brian will add a dobro.  The album title comes from 			the first line of the second verse:  "There's a 			banana moon in the sky tonight."  Sam always called a 		crescent moon a banana moon.  
	<li>	<strong>Cover Contribution:</strong> The banana moon 			is the contribution from this song.
