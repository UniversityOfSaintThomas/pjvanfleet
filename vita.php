		This paper considers Gibbs' phenomenon for scaling vectors in L<sup>2</sup>(<strong>R</strong>). We first show 		that a wide class of multiresolution analyses suffer from Gibbs' phenomenon.
		<p></p>
		To deal with this problem, in [11], Walter and Shen use an Abel summation technique to construct a positive 		scaling  function P<sub>r</sub>, 0 < r < 1, from an orthonormal scaling function $\phi$ that generates  V<sub>0			</sub>.  A reproducing kernel can in turn be constructed using P<sub>r</sub>.  This kernel is  also positive, 		has unit integral, and approximations utilitizing it display no Gibbs' phenomenon.  These results were extended 		to scaling vectors and multiwavelets in [9].  In both cases, orthogonality and compact support were lost in the 		construction process.
		<p></p>
		In this paper we modify the approach given in [9] to construct compactly  supported positive scaling vectors. 		While the mapping into V<sub>0</sub> associated with this new positive scaling vector is not a projection, the 		scaling vector does produce a Riesz basis for V<sub>0</sub> and we conclude  the paper by illustrating
		that expansions of functions via positive scaling vectors exhibit no Gibbs' phenomenon.

		In many applications of image processing, the given data are integer-valued.  It is therefore desirable to 			construct transformations that map data of this type to an integer (or rational) ring.  Calderbank,
		Daubechies, Sweldens, and Yeo [1] devised two methods for modifying orthogonal and biorthonal wavelets so that 		they map integers to integers.
		<p></p>
		The first method involves appropriately scaling the transform so that data that has been transformed and 			truncated can be recovered via the inverse wavelet transform.  In developing this method, the authors of
		[1] created a useful factorization of the 4-tap Daubechies orthogonal wavelet transform [2].  We have observed 		that this factorization can be extended to 4-tap multiwavelets of arbitrary size.
		<p></p>
		In this paper we will discuss this generalization and illustrate the factorization on two multiwavelets.  In 		particular, the well-known Donovan, Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust (DGHM) [3] multiwavelet transform can be 		scaled so that it maps integers to integers.  Since this transform is (anti)symmetric in addition to 				orthogonal, regular, and compactly supported, the ability to modify it so that it maps integers to integers 		should be useful in image processing applications.

		A degree elevation formula for multivariate simplex splines was given by Micchelli [6] and extended to hold for 		multivariate Dirichlet splines in [8].  We report similar formulae for multivariate cone splines and

		Let $\phi$ be a compactly supported, orthonormal scaling function that generates the linear space V<sub>0</sub>		in L<sup>2</sup>(<strong>R</strong>).  We are motivated by the work of Walter and Shen [7].  In this paper, the 		authors use an Abel summation technique to build a positive scaling function P<sub>r</sub>, 0 < r < 1, for the 		space V<sub>0</sub>.  A reproducing kernel can in turn be constructed using P<sub>r</sub>.  This kernel is also
		positive, has unit integral, and approximations utilitizing it display no Gibbs' phenomenon.
		<p></p>
		A natural question and thus the purpose of this paper is to ask whether the work in [7] can be generalized to 		the scaling vector setting; and, if so, what advantages are there to be gained.  In this paper, we show that 		such a generalization does indeed exist and an anologous kernel can be constructed.  The construction requires 		that the sum of the integer translates of each component of the scaling vector be nonnegative - a requirement 		not necessarily satisfied by a general scaling vector.  We obtain our results by assuming this property is 			satisfied and then conclude the paper by exhibiting an invertible linear transformation that takes a scaling 		vector satisfying modest conditions and maps it to one suitable for our construction.

		<p></p>
		We consider the problem of large-scale evaluation of multivariate simplicial splines.  These splines arise 			naturally as the multivariate analog of B-splines and are useful in applications such as finite element 			methods and computer-aided geometric design (CAGD).  Simplicial splines have much in common with their 			univariate analog.  They are piecewise polynomial functions whose smoothness and support can be controlled by 		knot placement.  In addition, these splines obey a recurrence formula.  Unlike the univariate case, 				implementation of this formula poses some problems.  If x in <strong>R</strong><sup>s</sup> lies on an (s-1)-		dimensional hyperplane <i>H</i> connecting two or more knot points, then the recurrence formula cannot be 			utilized.
		<p></p>
		Results on the evaluation of multivariate simplicial splines are documented in [7,10].  In both cases, the 			authors use perturbation techniques when faced with evaluating the spline at x in <i>H</i>.  In [7], the author 		suggests a stable means for evaluating simplicial splines at points on the interior of regions formed by (s-1)		-dimensional hyperplanes and we augment this method with a scheme for evaluating points on any such hyperplane.   		Our method is especially suited to large-scale evaluation of the spline and it is numerically stable when the 		evaluation is performed near or on (s-1)-dimensional hyperplanes.  Examples are given to demonstrate the
		algorithm.

		In Chui and Wang [3], support properties are derived for a scaling function generating a function space 			V<sub>0</sub> in L<sup>2</sup>(<strong>R</strong>).  Motivated by this work, we consider support properties for 		scaling vectors.  In [9], Goodman and Lee derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the scaling
		vector {\phi_1,...., \phi_r}, r > 0, to form a Riesz basis for V<sub>0</sub> and develop a general theory for 		spline wavelets of multiplicity r > 1.  We consider conditions under which linear combinations of scaling 			functions generate V<sub>0</sub>.  These conditions also characterize all other scaling vectors that generate 		the same V<sub>0</sub>.  In addition we describe the scaling vectors of minimal support for V<sub>0</sub>.
		<p></p>
		Next, we give sufficient conditions on the two-scale symbol for scaling vectors under which a given matrix 			refinement equation can be solved.  A spline-wavelet example illustrates these results.
		<p></p>
		For the single scaling function \phi, the support of \phi is characterized by the degree of the two-scale 			symbol.  The situation is more complicated in the scaling vector case.  We prove a result that gives the 		 	support of the scaling vector under certain conditions on the coefficient matrices.  This result is illustrated 		by an example of fractal wavelets derived in Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust [8].

		A generalization of McFarland's iterative scheme for solving quadratic equations in Banach spaces is reported.  		The notion of a <i>uniformly contractive system</i> is introduced and subsequently employed to investigate
		the convergence of a new iterative method for approximating solutions to this wider class of multipower 			equations.  Existence and uniqueness of solutions are addressed within the framework of a uniformly contractive 		system.  To illustrate the use of the new iterative scheme, we employ it when approximating solutions to a 			Hammerstein equation and a Chandrashekar equation.  Due to the nature of the examples, we have found that 			wavelet/scaling function bases are a natural choice for the implementation of our iterative method.

		In 1983, deBoor and DeVore [3] introduced multivariate box splines.  These splines are analogs of univariate B-		splines (see [1]).  In addition they can be viewed as probability distribution functions.  We consider the 			numerical computation of the moments of multivariate box splines with arbitrary knot sets.  To this end, we 		derive recurrence formulas for the moments of box splines.  An algorithm for the implementation of our results 		is constructed.

		We report an extension of a result due to M. Daehlen [8] whereby an s-variate box spline can be evaluated using 		-1)-variate simplex splines.  In order to derive his algorithm, Daehlen employed a result of Cohen, Lyche, and 		Riesenfeld [7] that illustrates how an s-variate cone spline can be expressed as a combination of (s-1)-variate 		simplex splines.  The result of [7] defines a special linear map \pi : <strong>R</strong><sup>s</sup> to 			<strong>R</strong> that depends on a nonsingular matrix V.  In order for the algorithm to succeed, Daehlen 			requires the condition that V must be chosen so that \pi(x<sup>i</sup>) > 0 for each of the box spline knot  		points x<sup>i</sup>, i=1,...,n.  We report a method for constructing V that satisfies the condition \pi(x<sup>		i</sup>) > 0.  We then discuss the implementation of our result Daehlen's algorithm.
